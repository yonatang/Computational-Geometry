Best solution is circle-blowing algorithm, which divides the problem into two:
1. Choose "good" sensor layout.
2. Given layout of the sensors, increase the circles until optimal (local optimal?) is reached.

Things to improve:
1. Better layout algorithm. 
Pre-calculated the first 9 layouts, but the rest are sub-optimal.
2. GUI can always be improved
